```

## Is there a change log?

[Yes][history].

## How do I set up the build environment?

The build environment relies on
node.js,
[JSHint],
[Mocha],
[Chai] and
[UglifyJS].
Assuming that you already have node and NPM set up,
you just need to run `npm install` to
install all of the dependencies as listed in `package.json`.

You can lint the code
with the command `npm run lint`.

You can run the unit tests
with the command `npm test`.
