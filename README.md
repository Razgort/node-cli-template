## Is there a change log?

[Yes][history].

## How do I set up the build environment?

The build environment relies on
node.js,
[JSHint],
[Mocha],
[Chai] and
[UglifyJS].
Assuming that you already have node and NPM set up,
you just need to run `npm install` to
install all of the dependencies as listed in `package.json`.

The unit tests are in `test/check-types.js`.
You can run them with the command `npm test`.
To run the tests in a web browser,
open `test/check-types.html`.

You can lint the code
with the command `npm run lint`.
